How does that compare to the mean amount of time spent daily in the week before the promotion?\n","- What is the mean sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa for the period 2006-2010?\n","\n","\n","**When we only have a sample but want to find the mean in the population**, the best we can do is to compute the **sample mean** $\\overline{x}$ and hope it's a **good estimate** for the **population mean** $\\mu$.
