An interesting distribution property we haven't yet discussed is **variability**. Consider, for instance, these two distributions of numerical values:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1oLZvk-JGfbK9vrxSW3vOgyRKKGhWHHVN\">\n","\n","\n","The values of the distribution A don't vary — each value is 4. The values in distribution B  show some variability — they are not all identical, and the values can be either 8 or 0. **If we were to quantify variability**, we could assign a value of 0 to A to indicate that it has no variability. But **what variability value should we assign to distribution B?**\n","\n","We need a measure to summarize the **variability** of these two distributions. The summary metrics we've learned so far don't tell us anything about variability. The **mean**, the **median**, and the **mode** of distribution A are all 4, and distribution B has a **mean** and a **median** of 4, and **no mode**. If we were to judge variability based on these values, we'd probably have to conclude that the variabilities of the two distributions are equal, which is wrong.\n","\n","One intuitive way to measure the variability of a distribution is to find the **difference between the maximum and the minimum value**. Both the maximum and the minimum of distribution  A is 4, so the variability of distribution  is 0:\n","\n","$$\n","max(A) - min(A) = 4 - 4 = 0\n","$$\n","\n","We call this measure of variability the **range**. So the range of distribution A is 0.

Rather, we want to use the samples to make inferences about their corresponding populations. **Let's find out whether the standard deviation of a sample is a good estimate for the standard deviation in the corresponding population**.\n","\n","Remember that we defined the standard deviation (SD) as:\n","\n","\n","$$\n","SD = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - \\mu)^2 + (x_2 - \\mu)^2 + \\ldots + (x_N - \\mu)^2}{N}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}}\n","$$\n","\n","Notice in the formula that we used the population mean $\\mu$, which means that if we wanted to compute the standard deviation of a sample, we'd have to know $\\mu$. In practice,  $\\mu$ is almost never known, and we can't find it from our sample either, but we can estimate $\\mu$ using the sample mean $\\overline{x}$.\n","\n","We update slightly the formula for the sample standard deviation by changing  to  and  to  (remember that  describes the number of data points in a population, while  describes the number of data points in a sample):\n","\n","\n","$$\n","SD_{sample} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - \\overline{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\overline{x})^2 + \\ldots + (x_n - \\overline{x})^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n}}\n","$$\n","\n","Now that we have a working formula, can use it to reliably estimate the population standard deviation? One way we can check this is by sampling repeatedly a known population and see how the sample standard deviations compare on average to the population standard deviation.\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","- Let's consider the data we have for **SalePrice** a population and sample it 5000 times.

One way to do that is to decrease the value of the denominator. For instance, in $\\frac{12}{6} = 2$, the denominator is 6. If we decrease the value of the denominator, we get a greater result: $\\frac{12}{4}=3$.\n","\n","We'll decrease by 1 the denominator in the sample standard deviation formula, which now becomes:\n","\n","\n","$$\n","SD_{sample} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - \\overline{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\overline{x})^2 + \\ldots + (x_n - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","This small correction we added to the sample standard deviation (dividing by $n-1$ instead of $n$) is called **Bessel's correction**.
